# WooCommerce Product Addons to Bling
This small WooCommerce plugin enables a Woocommerce website to save the product addons data on Bling ERP Platform when creating a new WooCommerce order.

## How it works:

A product called 'Sunglass' with two options (box and color) will be integrated on Bling as "Sunglass - Box Square - Color Red" besides only "Sunglass".

The previous behaviour was forcing the e-commerce owner to look back on their WooCommerce store to find out which product options was chosen by their customers.

With this plugin, the e-commerce owner just see on Blink ERP panel which was the options selected by their customers.
